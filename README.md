# Simple Aeronautical Features (SAF)
SAF was created by IWXXM developers to represent a select set of aeronautical features with logical concistency with AIXM, as the full AIXM schema was prohibitive to include.  SAF has subsequently been replaced by profiling (i.e., creating a subset of) the AIXM schema.  Weather-related AIXM profiles may be found at https://ext.eurocontrol.int/aixmwiki_public/bin/view/Profiles/AIXM_WX.  SAF is no longer recommended for use and the contents of this repository may be considered deprecated.

SAF was utilized in IWXXM 1.0 and IWXXM 1.1.
